Saved the employee data in a json file with all specified fields.

Functionalities: 

1.  Can filter employees based on team selected from dropdown menu. Further filtering is possible if "Show only Bangalore Employees"
    checkbox is checked. Unchecking the checkbox reverts employee view filtered with selected team.
    
2.  Implemented routing functionality to navigate to search view upon clicking search button in vertical navbar.

3.  Upon entering details in search view, filtering based on these details and send filtered data to Home component view router.

4.  Upon receiving employee data filtered from search component, Home component renders it.

NOTE: No CSS framework has been used. I have only used font-awesome for icons.
